# Onip

*Going to add an image of the Engine editor here when there is a somewhat working version of it*

## About

Onip is a 2D Game Engine/Framework written in C++ and uses OpenGL for the rendering Pipeline. The Project is built by a unit student currently in their first year of studding computer science.

The Goal of the Project is to learn Game Engine architecture and to improve my C++ programming skills while also learning Graphics programming as I would like to support 3D in the future.

## Building/Install

The project uses CMake which should make it very easy to build on any operating system. You'll obviously need to have CMake and a C++ Compiler installed of your choice

### Linux/Mac Steps

Starting in the root directory, open the terminal and enter the following commands
```bash
$ mkdir bin
$ cd bin
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ make
```
Following those commands will build you a **RELEASE Build** of the engine, however, if you want a **DEBUG Build**, just replace the *Release* keyword with *Debug* or just remove the compiler definition.

### Windows

Make sure you have Visual Studio installed as compiling the engine using MSVC compiler is the easiest on this OS.
Open the directory in Visual Studio, then press *Ctr + b* to build the program. The build application will be in the Debug Folder. If you want **Release Build**, the setting that needs to be changed is at the top (currently set to Debug)
